 # Golan Application Dockerization Guide

## Scenario 

Your development team has just finished developping a GoLang application and uploaded it onto GitHub. Now, the operations team is tasked with containerizing this application using Docker for deployment purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with dockerizing the application, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Access to the Golan application's source code hosted on GitHub.
- Docker installed and configured on your local machine or deployment environment.

## Dockerization Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the GitHub repository containing the Golan application's source code to your local machine or deployment environment.

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**
   Using the command line interface, navigate to the directory where the Golan application's source code is located.

3. **Review the Application Structure:**
   Familiarize yourself with the structure of the Golan application and ensure all necessary files and dependencies are included.

4. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   If the Golan application does not already include a Dockerfile, create one in the root directory of the repository. The Dockerfile contains instructions for building a Docker image that encapsulates the application.

5. **Build the Docker Image:**
   Use the Docker command line interface to build the Docker image based on the instructions specified in the Dockerfile. This process compiles the Golan application and packages it into a Docker image.

6. **Verify the Docker Image:**
   Once the Docker image is built successfully, verify its existence using the Docker CLI. Ensure that the image has been created with the correct name and version.

7. **Test the Docker Image Locally:**
   Before deploying the Docker image to a production environment, test it locally to ensure that the Golan application functions as expected within the Docker container.

8. **Deploy the Docker Image:**
   Deploy the Docker image containing the Golan application to the desired deployment environment. This could be a local development environment, staging environment, or production environment, depending on the deployment strategy.


Happy dockerizing!
